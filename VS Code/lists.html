            multiple cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, 
            but dragons in Western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged,

          <dt>Vampires</dt>
          <dd>A vampire is a mythical creature that subsists by feeding on the vital 
            essence (generally in the form of blood) of the living. In European folklore, 
            vampires are undead creatures that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or
             deaths in the neighbourhoods which they inhabited while they were alive. </dd>
          <dt>Werewolf</dt>
          <dd>The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore, existing in many 
            variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation of 
            underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period</dd>
