            Yeah, yeah
            Kissing, I hope they caught us
            Whether they like or not (not)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna brag about it (yeah)
            I wanna tie the knot (knot)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (off), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (yeah), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you<br>
            Hold my hand
            You can hit while they watch, boy<br>
            Somethin' different about you
            Love it when he hit and smack too
            Baby, lemme lick on your tattoos
            That's true that I like PDA
            Take it to a seedy place
            Suck a little dick in the bathroom
            Who that man with the big strong hands
            On her ass in the club with the paps? Baby, that's you
            Front seat chillin' with the window down
            I be ten toes down on the dash getting' fast food
            Hope you can handle the heat
            Put your name in the streets
            Get used to my fans looking at you
            Fuck what they heard, I don't fuck with them birds
            I'm a mean kitty, don't get stabbed with the rat tooth
            Boys be mad that I don't fuck incels
            Girls hate too, gun to their pigtail
            I love you, I wanna big chill
            Boy, don't trip, I'll split a big bill
            Take you 'round the world, they don't have to understand
            Rub it in their face, put a rock on her hand<br>
            Kissing, I hope they caught us
            Whether they like or not (not)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna brag about it (yeah)
            I wanna tie the knot (knot)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (off), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (yeah), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you<br>
            Hold my hand
            You can hit while they watch, boy<br>
            'Cause love is pain but I need this shit (yeah)
            We fuck too good when the bean kicks in
            Like Fortnite, I'ma need your skin (yeah)
            Don't give a fuck where the penis been (uh)
            Boy, you're the one, you're the only man
            Me and you on my OnlyFans (come on)
            Holy cow, you're the Holy Trin' (Trin')
            Hold me down when a hole need dick
            Be my security, it's your therapy
            With you I ain't holding shit back
            When I need my space, you give that
            When he broke my heart, you fixed that
            With a long walk on the beach
            Love it when they honk-honk on the street
            When they see us zoom by in the Jeep
            We a whole damn joint, we an energy
            Baby, we could just ride on our enemies
            They all wanna know how you get to me
            Let 'em feel how they feel and be Philistines
            'Cause this type of love's the epitome, said<br>
            Kissing, I hope they caught us
            Whether they like or not (not)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna brag about it (yeah)
            I wanna tie the knot (knot)
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (off), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you (yeah), yeah, yeah
            I wanna show you off (off), I wanna show you off (off)
            I wanna show you<br>
            Hold my hand
            You can hit while they watch, boy
